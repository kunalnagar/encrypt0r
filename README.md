Easily Encrypt and Decrypt files on Mac, Windows and Linux

**Note:** Only single files supported for now. If you want to encrypt a folder, you need to zip it first and then drag it to encrypt0r

### Signing

If you download the app on Mac/Windows, you will get an untrusted developer warning. This is because the app is not signed by the developer (aka me). Signing an app requires a Signing Certificate that costs hundreds of dollars per year.

**Note:** It is absolutely safe to run the app on Mac/Windows. I'm not interested in your data or running malicious scripts. If you're worried about what the app is doing underneath, the code is all there, have at it :)

Here's the warning on Windows:
