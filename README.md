### 💡 Motivation

Sometimes you just need a quick way to encrypt files securely using a passphrase. I started this project to explore the world of Electron and learn about cryptography.

encrypt0r provides a simple drag and drop interface to encrypt/decrypt your files using a password.

### 🔏 Signing Issues

When running the app on Mac/Windows, you might get an untrusted developer warning. This is because the app is not signed by the developer (aka me). Signing an app requires a Signing Certificate that costs hundreds of dollars per year. Apart from the warning, the app works as advertised.

Here's a quick video of the warning on Windows: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIVz7MtNEO0
